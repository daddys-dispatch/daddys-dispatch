# 👋 Hi, I'm Daddy!
Just a CSE student trying to survive exams with the help of this GitHub account. This is basically my stash of code to save me from last-minute panic attacks and practice like I'm actually prepared. 🎓💻

Here you’ll find code, maybe a few random experiments, and definitely some panicked last-minute attempts at understanding whatever I thought I'd learn in class. Enjoy the chaos!
